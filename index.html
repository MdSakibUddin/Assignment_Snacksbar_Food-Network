                <h1><b>Beef steak</b></h1>
                <p class="recipe-descripption">
                    Prepare the coals or a gas grill for direct heat. Heat to medium heat, which will take about 40
                    minutes
                    for charcoal or about 10 minutes for a gas grill.
                    Place the beef on the grill rack over medium heat. Cover the grill; cook 6 to 8 minutes for rib eye,
                    10
                    to 12 minutes for porterhouse and T-bone or 13 to 15 minutes for sirloin and tenderloin, turning
                    beef
                    once halfway through cooking, until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted in center of thickest
                    part
                    reads 145°F for medium-rare or 160°F for medium doneness. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
                </p>

                <h1><b>Salad's Buffet</b></h1>
                <p>This is a refreshing salad using all different kinds of vegetables. You can use whatever you like,
                    but
                    the main things that makes it good are the tomatoes and cucumbers. It is much like an Israeli salad.
                    The
                    homemade dressing is very good on it, but so is just plain olive oil.</p>

                    Stir in
                    milk and eggs until mixture is smooth.Spray preheated waffle iron with non-stick cooking spray. Pour
                    two
                    tablespoons of the waffle batter onto the hot waffle iron. Place two slices of banana on top of the
                    batter and then spoon another two tablespoons of batter on top of the banana. Cook until golden
                    brown.
