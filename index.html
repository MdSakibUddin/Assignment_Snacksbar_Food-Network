                <h1><b>Beef steak</b></h1>
                <p class="recipe-descripption">
                    Prepare the coals or a gas grill for direct heat. Heat to medium heat, which will take about 40
                    minutes
                    for charcoal or about 10 minutes for a gas grill.
                    Place the beef on the grill rack over medium heat. Cover the grill; cook 6 to 8 minutes for rib eye,
                    10
                    to 12 minutes for porterhouse and T-bone or 13 to 15 minutes for sirloin and tenderloin, turning
                    beef
                    once halfway through cooking, until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted in center of thickest
                    part
                    reads 145°F for medium-rare or 160°F for medium doneness. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

                <h1><b>White Sauce Pasta</b></h1>
                <p>White Sauce Pasta is an easy-to-make recipe of cooked pasta in a delicious white sauce – also known
                    as Béchamel sauce. Simply prepare the white sauce – a mixture of butter, milk, flour and spices and
                    pour it over your cooked pasta.This popular dish is vegetarian and can be served as a snack or light
                    dinner. Make it more hearty and nutritious by adding some mixed vegetables.When preparing pasta
                    recipes, whole wheat pasta is always a great healthy choice. I have used whole wheat penne in this
                    recipe, however, you can use any pasta you prefer, including different varieties like macaroni,
                    rigatoni or farfalle..</p>

                <h1><b>Banana Waffle</b></h1>
                <p>Preheat waffle iron. In a large mixing bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, salt and nutmeg.
                    Stir in
                    milk and eggs until mixture is smooth.Spray preheated waffle iron with non-stick cooking spray. Pour
                    two
                    tablespoons of the waffle batter onto the hot waffle iron. Place two slices of banana on top of the
                    batter and then spoon another two tablespoons of batter on top of the banana. Cook until golden
                    brown.
                    Serve hot.</p>
